## Overview
The spin-orbit interaction is a relativistic effect that considers the coupling of a particle's spin degree of freedom to the magnetic field it experiences by orbiting the nucleus. From now on, I will use an electron as the particle. The magnetic field is actually the nuclear electric field, but since the electron is orbiting the nucleus, it is a magnetic field in the rest frame of the electron. Therefore, the electron is experiencing a magnetic field due to its orbital motion around the nucleus. The energy of this interaction is given by 

$$\Delta H = - \boldsymbol{\mu} \cdot \boldsymbol{B},$$

which splits atomic energy levels and we can expect the same to occur in a condensed matter system. In the language of Atomic Physics, we can see this coupling more explicitly with the addition of angular momentum theory,

$$\boldsymbol{J} = \boldsymbol{L} + \boldsymbol{S} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{L} \cdot \boldsymbol{S} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ J^2 - L^2 - S^2 \right],$$

where $$L^2 = l(l+1)$$ and $S^2 = s(s+1)$ are operators that act on the electron's orbital and spin degrees of freedom (given by the quantum numbers $l$ and $s$), respectively, and $J^2$ is an operator that acts on the electron's new degree of freedom (given by the quantum number $j$) defined by the addition of its spin and orbital-angular momenta. The theory of addition of angular momentum shows that

$$ |l-s| \leq j \leq l+s.$$

Since $j$ can take on multiple values for combinations of $l$ and $s$, the atomic energy levels are split by this new degree of freedom.

Now that we understand how the spin-orbit interaction works in atomic systems, namely that it splits energy levels, we can turn our attention to a condensed matter system and make the conjecture that the spin-orbit interaction will split band degeneracies. The **goal of this study** is to understand the effect that spin-orbit coupling has on a condensed matter system, which is best understood through its band structure, so we will take on perhaps the simplest condensed matter system, the tight-binding model on a square lattice. 

## Tight-Binding Model

To understand the effect of spin-orbit coupling, let's consider a relatively simple system, the tight-binding (TB) model on a square lattice. I don't want to embark on a discussion about the TB model, so I will just summarize it by saying that the TB model considers the limit where the electrons are *tightly* bound to the nucleus, so their wavefunctions are very similar to the atomic wavefunctions. But when we bring atoms close together in a lattice, the atomic wavefunctions overlap enough to warrent corrections. Therefore, the electrons can *hop* between neighbors, which is determined by a hopping matrix. For more details on the TB model, a good discussion is given [here](http://physics.bu.edu/~okctsui/PY543/5_notes_Tight%20Binding.pdf). 

The TB hamiltonian is

$$\hat{\mathcal{H}} = -t \sum_{(i,j)} \sum_{\sigma} (c_{i,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{j,\sigma} + c_{j,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{i,\sigma}),$$

where we sum over nearest neighbors, $\sigma$ denotes the spin index and $t$ is the hopping integral. In one dimension the energy bands is given by $E_{ \pm} = -2t \cos (k)$ and in two dimensions the energy band is given by $E = -2t [ \cos(k_x) + \cos(k_y)]$. You can see the derivation [here](https://github.com/darin-momayezi/Project-Portfolio/blob/ce80208bb974b468f6652429fc23edc4aa433c8a/Spin%20Orbit%20Interaction/PHYS6211_HW2.pdf). The band structure of the TB model is

## Spin-Orbit Interaction

We can account for the spin-orbit interaction by including a revised hopping matrix in the hamiltonian

$$\hat{\mathcal{H}} = -t \sum_{(i,j)} \sum_{\sigma} (c_{i,\sigma}^{\dagger} R_{ij}^{\sigma,\sigma'} c_{j,\sigma} + h.c.),$$

where the hopping matrix $R_{ij}^{ \sigma, \sigma'}$ is given by $exp[i \vec{A} \cdot ( \vec{r}_i - \vec{r}_j)]$ and $\vec{A}$ is given by the abelian guage $( \alpha \sigma_y, \beta \sigma_x, 0)$, where $\alpha = - \beta$ corresponds to Rashba spin-orbit coupling. By transforming to momentum space (calculations shown in the writeup linked in the top note), the hamiltonian can be rewritten as

$$\hat{\mathcal{H}} = -t \sum_k \psi_k^{ \dagger} H(k) \psi_k,$$

where

$$ \psi_k = (c_{k, \sigma}^{ \dagger}, c_{k, \sigma})^T$$

$$H(k) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & R_k^{ \sigma} \\\ (R_k^{ \sigma})^{ \dagger} & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

and the energy spectrum is given by $E_{ \pm} = -t ( \pm |R_k^{ \sigma})|)$. Solving for the energy bands in momentum space in a similar fashion to how we calculated them without SOI gives 
$$E_{ \pm} (\boldsymbol{k}) = d_0( \boldsymbol{k}) \pm | \boldsymbol{d}( \boldsymbol{k})|,$$ 
where 
$$\boldsymbol{d}_0(k) = -2t ( \cos \alpha \cos k_x + \cos \beta \cos k_y)$$ 
$$\boldsymbol{d}( \boldsymbol{k}) = -2t ( \sin \beta \sin k_y, \sin \alpha \sin k_x, 0)$$.

Since we are in the spin basis we can also derive the spin *texture* and plot it with the band structure

The first plot is for the choise $\alpha = - \beta = 1$ and the second for $\alpha = -\beta = \pi /2$. The points where the top and bottom bands meet are dirac points and the immediate region around it is called the dirac cone. In this region the electron spins are locked perpendicular to their momentum

Our intuition from atomic physics was correct; the SOI does split energy levels. Notice the similar forms of the energy levels with and without the SOI. These band structures look awfully close to topological insulators where the conducting (upper) band is protected from the valence (lower) band, so the electrons in the top band move like it were a conductor and those in the valence band move like it were an insulator. To prove that we have derived the band structure for a topological insulator we need to prove that the conducting and valence bands are topologically distinct and, therefore, protected. Around dirac points, the bands of topological insulator have been shown to be *twisted*

We can visually see this by looking at the band structure for the choice of $\alpha = - \beta = \pi /2$ from a bird's eye point of view

We can see that the dirac points are diagonally twisted like the second bandstructure. What started as an investigation about the effect of SOI on a square-lattice system approximated by the TB model became a discovery of topological insulators (almost)!

## Conclusion

The SOI splits energy bands and creates dirac points. Electron spins in the region of these dirac points are locked perpendicular to their momentum, wrapping around the dirac cone. Topological calculations can show that the conducting and valence bands are topologically distinct and, therefore, protected, proving that we have derived the band structure of a topological insulator. These calculation have implications for the spin Quantum Hall Effect, which will be explored in another post.

The intention of this post was only to give a brief overview of the calculations and results regarding the SOI. For more details, please have a look at the writeup linked in the note at the top of this page.
