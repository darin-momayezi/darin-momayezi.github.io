## Overview
The spin-orbit interaction is a relativistic effect that considers the couppling of a particle's spin degree of freedom to the magnetic field it experiences by orbiting the nucleus. From now on, I will use an electron as the particle. The magnetic field is actually the nuclear electric field, but since the electron is orbiting the nucleus it is a magnetic field in the rest frame of the electron. Therefore, the electron is experiencing a magnetic field due to its orbital motion around the nucleus. The energy of this interaction is given by 

$$\Delta H = - \boldsymbol{\mu} \cdot \boldsymbol{B},$$

which splits atomic energy levels and we can expect the same to occur in a condensed matter system. In the language of Atomic Physics, we can see this coupling more explicitly with the addition of angular momentum theory,

$$\boldsymbol{J} = \boldsymbol{L} + \boldsymbol{S} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{L} \cdot \boldsymbol{S} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ J^2 - L^2 - S^2 \right].$$
