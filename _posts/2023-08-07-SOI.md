## Overview
The spin-orbit interaction is a relativistic effect that considers the coupling of a particle's spin degree of freedom to the magnetic field it experiences by orbiting the nucleus. From now on, I will use an electron as the particle. The magnetic field is actually the nuclear electric field, but since the electron is orbiting the nucleus, it is a magnetic field in the rest frame of the electron. Therefore, the electron is experiencing a magnetic field due to its orbital motion around the nucleus. The energy of this interaction is given by 

$$\Delta H = - \boldsymbol{\mu} \cdot \boldsymbol{B},$$

which splits atomic energy levels and we can expect the same to occur in a condensed matter system. In the language of Atomic Physics, we can see this coupling more explicitly with the addition of angular momentum theory,

$$\boldsymbol{J} = \boldsymbol{L} + \boldsymbol{S} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{L} \cdot \boldsymbol{S} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ J^2 - L^2 - S^2 \right],$$

where $L^2 = l(l+1)$ and $S^2 = s(s+1)$ are operators that act on the electron's orbital and spin degrees of freedom (given by the quantum numbers $l$ and $s$), respectively, and $J^2$ is an operator that acts on the electron's new degree of freedom (given by the quantum number $j$) defined by the addition of its spin and orbital-angular momenta. The theory of addition of angular momentum shows that

$$ |l-s| \leq j \leq l+s.$$

Since $j$ can take on multiple values for combinations of $l$ and $s$, the atomic energy levels are split by this new degree of freedom.

Now that we understand how the spin-orbit interaction works in atomic systems, namely that it splits energy levels, we can turn our attention to a condensed matter system and make the conjecture that the spin-orbit interaction will split band degeneracies. The **goal of this study** is to understand the effect that spin-orbit coupling has on a condensed matter system, which is best understood through its band structure, so we will take on perhaps the simplest condensed matter system, the tight-binding model on a square lattice. 

## Tight-Binding Model

To understand the effect of spin-orbit coupling, let's consider a relatively simple system, the tight-binding (TB) model on a square lattice. I don't want to embark on a discussion about the TB model, so I will just summarize it by saying that the TB model considers the limit where the electrons are *tightly* bound to the nucleus, so their wavefunctions are very similar to the atomic wavefunctions. But when we bring atoms close together in a lattice, the atomic wavefunctions overlap enough to warrent corrections. Therefore, the electrons can *hop* between neighbors, which is determined by a hopping matrix. For more details on the TB model, a good discussion is given [here](http://physics.bu.edu/~okctsui/PY543/5_notes_Tight%20Binding.pdf). 

The TB hamiltonian is

$$\hat{\mathcal{H}} = -t \sum_{(i,j)} \sum_{\sigma} (c_{i,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{j,\sigma} + c_{j,\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{i,\sigma}),$$

where we sum over nearest neighbors, $\sigma$ denotes the spin index and $t$ is the hopping integral. The band structure of the TB model (you can see the derivation [here](https://github.com/darin-momayezi/Project-Portfolio/blob/ce80208bb974b468f6652429fc23edc4aa433c8a/Spin%20Orbit%20Interaction/PHYS6211_HW2.pdf)) is
