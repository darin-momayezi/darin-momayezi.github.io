# Education

### University of Washington, Seattle, WA

Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Physics, 2024 - current

### Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA
Bachelor of Science in Physics, 2024

### Research Experience

**Member**, *Dr. Armita Nourmohammad's Statistical Physics of Evolving Systems Lab*, Department of Physics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA
(January 2025-Present)
- Application of Optimal Transport (OT) to the evolution of T-cells in diverse antigenic environments. This project aims to study immune responses to bacteria and viruses at the cellular level using surface protein expression data.
- Study of informational quantities such as mutual information between cells in evolving T-cell populations to understand phenomena such as cell differentation/the epigenetic landscape (current).
- Application of machine learning (variational autoencoders) and dynamic OT to convert the study of T-cell evolution using static OT to a spatially and temporally continuous setting (current). 

**Member**, *Dr. Roman Grigoriev's Nonlinear Dynamics Lab*, Center for Nonlinear Science, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (January 2022-Present)

- Application of Machine Learning (Autoencoders) to problems in Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics: dimensionality reduction, time-series prediction, and model discovery.
- Investigation of small-scale/fine structure of Navier-Stokes using simulations on mesh grids and Autoencoders.
- 1D-PDE toy problem
- Currently in progress: development of model discovery techniques with NNs and the 2D Navier Stokes equations.

**Member**, *Dr. Michael Schatz's Nonlinear Dynamics Lab*, Center for Nonlinear Science, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (January 2023-Present)
- Experimental and thoeretical study of single particle-fluid interactions in turbulent flow.
- Use of model discovery algorithm SPIDER (Sparse Physics-Informed Derivation of Empirical Relations) for deriving equations of motion of particles in flows.
- Skills: cameras, particle tracking, particle image velocimetry (PIV), model discovery.


**Member**, *Dr. Yiping Zhao's Nanotechnology Lab*, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Georgia, Athens,
GA (March 2021-December 2021)
- Literature review of Microwave-Assisted Hydrothermal-Synthesis
- Investigation and engineering of many species of pollens as magnetically actuated micromotors (electron-beam evaporation for magnetic layer, AC and rotating magnetic fields for magnetic actuation)
- Experimental Skills: Preparation of glass slides, microscopes/cameras, solenoids, ImageJ, and other lab equipment.
- Newtonian mechanics and electromagnetic theory.
